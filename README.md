# 1.6-Generics-Level1

## üìÑ Description ‚Äì Exercise Statement

This project contains the solution to the following Java exercises:

### Exercise 1
Create a class called `NoGenericMethods` that stores three arguments of the same type.  
The class must include:
- A constructor to initialize the three arguments.
- Getters and setters to access/modify the values.

Verify that the arguments can be passed in **any order** to the constructor.

#### ‚úÖ What was implemented
- `NoGenericMethods` class with three attributes of the same type.
- Constructor that accepts values in any order.
- Methods to get and set each argument.
- `NoGenericMethodsApp` with a `main()` to demonstrate usage.

---

### Exercise 2
Create a class called `Persona` with attributes:
- `name`
- `surname`
- `age`

Then, create a class called `GenericMethods` with a **generic method** that accepts three generic arguments.  
The method should simply print the arguments it receives.

In the `main()` method of `GenericMethodsApp`, call the generic method with parameters of different types to verify that any type and order is allowed.

Example: a `Persona` object, a `String`, and a primitive type.

#### ‚úÖ What was implemented
- `Persona` class with attributes, constructor, and `toString()` for readable output.
- `GenericMethods` class with a method:
 ```
public <T, U, V> void printArguments(T arg1, U arg2, V arg3)
 ```
- `GenericMethodsApp` class with a `main()` to test:
  - `Persona`, `String`, and `int`.
  - Other combinations like `String`, `double`, `boolean`.
